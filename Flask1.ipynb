    "Ans: Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It is designed to be lightweight and simple, providing the essential tools and features for\n",

    "described as a \"micro\" framework because it doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of larger frameworks like Django. Instead, it\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages of using the Flask framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalism. It provides just the basic tools needed to get a web application up and running,\n",
    "making it easy to understand and learn for both beginners and experienced developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask gives developers the freedom to choose and integrate various components such as databases, templating engines, and \n",
    "authentication systems according to their project's specific requirements. This flexibility allows you to build custom solutions tailored \n",
    "to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Since Flask is a micro framework, it has a small codebase and a minimal set of dependencies. This results in faster development\n",
    "times and better performance, especially for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins available, which can be easily integrated into your project. These extensions\n",
    "cover a wide range of functionalities, including authentication, form handling, database integration, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Community: Flask has a large and active community of developers, which means you can find plenty of documentation, tutorials, and support online. \n",
    "This community support can be invaluable when you encounter issues or need help with your Flask project.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, making it a popular choice for creating web services and backend APIs that serve as the\n",
    "foundation for web and mobile applications."
